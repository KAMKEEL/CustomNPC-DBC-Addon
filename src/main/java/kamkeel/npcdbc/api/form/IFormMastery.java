/**
 * This interface is heavily based on how DBC calculates its form masteries. Please check any race's form_mastery.cfg config to
 * get a better understanding on how this interface functions
 * <p>
 * Example: Strength attribute is 100,000,
 * <p>
 * A flat level of 1.5x causes this to be 150,000 out of the gate even at form level 0.
 * <p>
 * A PerLevel of 0.01x causes the attribute to increase 1.01x per form level. At level 1, strength is 101,000. At level 100, strength is 200,000.
 * A -0.01x causes strength to be 50,000 at level 50. Negative values are useful for stuff like Ki Drain.
 * <p>
 * A MaxLevel caps the effective multiplier of all the above. A max level of 1.5x makes sure that the flat level and perlevel multis will not go above 1.5x, even at max form level.
 * A max level of 0.1x (min in this case, thus the minormax) and a negative perlevel value of -0.01x makes sure that Ki Drain at player's max form level will only be 10x lower than at level 0, and not any lower.
